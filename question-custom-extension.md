Based on the analysis of your tool, its prompts, and the strategic context provided in `GEMINI.md`, here is a recommendation on whether to develop it as a Gemini Extension.



\*\*Short Answer:\*\*



No, you should not \*replace\* your CLI with a Gemini Extension. Instead, you should evolve your architecture so that a Gemini Extension becomes one of several interfaces to your core functionality, alongside the CLI.



\*\*Analysis and Recommendation:\*\*



Your current CLI is a powerful tool for automation, scripting, and direct file system operations, which is a significant advantage for power users and integration into larger workflows. A Gemini Extension, on the other hand, offers a more intuitive, natural language interface for a broader audience.



The ideal solution, which aligns with the architectural roadmap described in your `GEMINI.md` file, is to structure your application to support \*\*both\*\*.



Here is the recommended strategic path:



1\.  \*\*Modularize the Core Logic:\*\* Refactor your code to separate the core functionality (reading prompts, calling the LLM, processing text) into a reusable JavaScript module. This module should be independent of any specific interface like `commander`.



2\.  \*\*Create an API:\*\* Wrap the core module in an Express.js API, as planned in your roadmap. This API will expose endpoints for `clean`, `compare-quick`, and `compare-detailed`. This turns your logic into a scalable service.



3\.  \*\*Develop Interfaces:\*\*

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*CLI:\*\* Your existing CLI will be simplified. Instead of containing all the logic, it will just make HTTP calls to your new API.

&nbsp;   \*   \*\*Gemini Extension:\*\* You can now easily create a Gemini Extension. The extension's functions will also make calls to your API. This provides a natural language front-end without duplicating any of the core logic.



\*\*Benefits of this Approach:\*\*



\*   \*\*Single Source of Truth:\*\* Your core cleaning and comparison logic (including the prompts) lives in one place (the core module), making it easy to maintain and improve.

\*   \*\*Multi-Interface Support:\*\* You get the best of both worlds: a scriptable CLI for power users and an intuitive Gemini Extension for interactive use.

\*   \*\*Scalability:\*\* Building on an API aligns with your long-term vision of evolving to a more robust architecture like Nest.js and CQRS.

\*   \*\*Consistency:\*\* All interfaces (CLI, Extension, and any future web app) will provide consistent results because they all rely on the same backend API.



Developing your tool as \*only\* a Gemini Extension would mean losing the significant benefits of a CLI for automation and local file system tasks. The recommended path allows you to serve different user needs while building a more robust and maintainable application.
